How to Make Instant Pot Easy-Peel Hard Boiled Eggs,,,4 minutes,"1
to 12 servings",Large eggs Large eggs,"Prepare the pressure cooker:Place a steamer basket in the bottom of your Instant Pot. Add 1/2 to 1 inch of water (1 to 2 cups) to the pressure cooker (check your pressure cooker manual for minimal liquid amounts). The water level should be just below the steamer basket.Emma ChristensenEmma Christensen | Add all the eggs:Use cold eggs, straight from the fridge. You can cook as many eggs as you like at one time, but be careful of wedging eggs too firmly against one another or stacking eggs on top of each other since these can cause eggs to crack.Emma Christensen | Bring the pot up to pressure:Close the lid on the pressure cooker and make sure the steam valve is set to the ""sealed"" position. Set the pressure to high and set the timer for 4 minutes for electric pressure cookers (3 minutes for stovetop).The pressure cooker will take 5 to 10 minutes to come to full pressure and then begin cooking. Cooking time begins once the cooker has come to pressure.Emma ChristensenEmma Christensen | Let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes:After cooking is done, let the pressure cooker sit for 5 minutes with the lid on and the steam vent ""sealed"" to allow steam to begin releasing naturally. (If you're using a stovetop pressure cooker, remove it from heat.)Emma Christensen | Quick-release the remaining pressure:After 5 minutes of natural release, carefully flip the steam valve to ""venting"" and quick-release any remaining pressure.Emma Christensen | Cool the eggs:Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water to cool (add ice for more rapid cooling, but ice isn't necessarily for making easy-peel eggs). Change out the water as it warms until the eggs are cool, then refrigerate the eggs until needed.Did you love the recipe?

The mayo-ketchup can be prepared 5 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Peel and cut the plantains:20 minutes before you plan to sear the steaks, peel the plantains by cutting 1/2 inch off each end to remove the stems. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut a slit down the backside length of the plantain. Using the meaty part of your thumb, push up the peel to remove it from the plantain.Once the plantain is peeled, slice it in half down its length. Repeat with the remaining plantains.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Prepare your frying station:In a 12-inch frying pan, fill the pan with 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat.While you’re waiting for the oil to heat, prepare a draining station by placing a cooling rack over a sheet pan, or line a sheet pan with paper towels to absorb the frying oil.Set your oven to “warm” to hold the tostones once you’re done frying them.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Fry the plantains:Once the oil reaches 330°F, or forms little bubbles around the handle of a wooden spoon when you put it in the oil, add 4 slabs of plantain (you’ll cook these in two batches).Fry the plantains for 2 minutes, then use a pair of tongs to carefully flip them over. Fry the plantains for another 2 minutes, or until the tip of a knife slides in and out of the plantain with no resistance. Remove the plantains from the oil using tongs and place onto the sheet pan to absorb any extra oil.Repeat with the second batch of plantains.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Remove the steaks from the fridge:Before smashing the plantains, remove the steaks from the refrigerator to allow them to come to room temperature slightly. | Smash the plantains:Increase the frying pan of oil to medium-high heat while you smash the plantains.Place the plantain slab on a cutting board and lay a piece of parchment or wax paper over it. Press the plantain with a heavy pan (a cast iron skillet works well for this) to smash to a thickness of 1/3 inch.Slide a knife or thin spatula to separate the bottom of the plantain from the cutting board and return it to the rack.Smash the remaining plantains until they are all flat.Simply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Refry the plantains:Once the oil in the pan reaches 350°F (180°C), return the flattened plantains to the oil to fry them a second time. You will need to work in batches of 2 or 3 to avoid crowding the pan.Fry the plantains for 2 minutes on each side or until the edges are slightly brown and the exteriors are crispy.Remove the tostones from the oil using a pair of tongs and set them on the rack to drain while you fry the remaining plantains.Once all of the tostones are fried, place the sheet pan in the oven to keep warm while you sear the steaks.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Sear the steaks:Heat a 12-inch or larger skillet over medium-high heat. Once heat radiates from the pan, pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.Carefully, lay the steaks in the pan and use your fingers or a pair of tongs to press it down onto the skillet’s surface. This contact ensures an even sear. Sear the meat for 4 minutes (for medium-rare). Use a pair of tongs to flip the steaks to the other side and sear for another 4 minutes.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Let the steaks rest:Remove the steaks from the pan and allow them to rest for 5 minutes. | Assemble the jibarito sandwiches:Assemble the sandwiches by spreading 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mayo-ketchup onto each tostón.

You should be able to cut it with a gentle wiggle with the side of your spoon.Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel | Add sesame oil and season:Stir in the sesame oil. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more soy sauce or sugar. The sauce should be flavorful and a little sweet to balance out the spiciness. | Serve the tteokbokki:Transfer the tteokbokki to a serving platter.
