Season the patties with 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning mix per side of the patty, if using.TipYou’ll have more seasoning mix than you need, but it keeps, tightly sealed, for up to 1 year.Simply Recipes / Nick Evans | Cook the burgers:Turn on the fan over the stove and open a window to help with air flow.Spray your skillet with a little non-stick spray and place burgers in the skillet. Press down on each patty with a spatula for 10 seconds. This is to encourage browning.Cook the burgers over medium heat for 4 minutes. Don’t touch them too much so you get a nice crust on the first side. Use a sturdy metal spatula to flip the burgers, being sure to scrape up any caramelization with the burger. | Flip the burgers:After you flip the burgers, add the cheese, if using, and continue to cook for 3 minutes until the burger is cooked to desired doneness, usually medium.If you are only cooking one burger, you can toast your buns in the same skillet as your patty, or you can toast them separately if you are cooking multiple burgers at once.If you want the cheese to be very melted, cover the burgers with a lid for the last minute of cooking.Simply Recipes / Nick EvansSimply Recipes / Nick EvansSimply Recipes / Nick Evans | Build the burgers and serve:Build your burgers by spreading some burger sauce on each bun. Put the burgers on the bottom bun and top with the lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and the top bun. Serve immediately with a cold drink.Did you love this recipe?

How to Make Instant Pot Easy-Peel Hard Boiled Eggs,,,4 minutes,"1
to 12 servings",Large eggs Large eggs,"Prepare the pressure cooker:Place a steamer basket in the bottom of your Instant Pot. Add 1/2 to 1 inch of water (1 to 2 cups) to the pressure cooker (check your pressure cooker manual for minimal liquid amounts). The water level should be just below the steamer basket.Emma ChristensenEmma Christensen | Add all the eggs:Use cold eggs, straight from the fridge. You can cook as many eggs as you like at one time, but be careful of wedging eggs too firmly against one another or stacking eggs on top of each other since these can cause eggs to crack.Emma Christensen | Bring the pot up to pressure:Close the lid on the pressure cooker and make sure the steam valve is set to the ""sealed"" position. Set the pressure to high and set the timer for 4 minutes for electric pressure cookers (3 minutes for stovetop).The pressure cooker will take 5 to 10 minutes to come to full pressure and then begin cooking. Cooking time begins once the cooker has come to pressure.Emma ChristensenEmma Christensen | Let the pressure release naturally for 5 minutes:After cooking is done, let the pressure cooker sit for 5 minutes with the lid on and the steam vent ""sealed"" to allow steam to begin releasing naturally. (If you're using a stovetop pressure cooker, remove it from heat.)Emma Christensen | Quick-release the remaining pressure:After 5 minutes of natural release, carefully flip the steam valve to ""venting"" and quick-release any remaining pressure.Emma Christensen | Cool the eggs:Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water to cool (add ice for more rapid cooling, but ice isn't necessarily for making easy-peel eggs). Change out the water as it warms until the eggs are cool, then refrigerate the eggs until needed.Did you love the recipe?

Place the cooked beef next to the spinach and carrots.Simply Recipes / Cynthia Christensen | Assemble the kimbap:You can set the strips of danmuji on the same large plate with the fillings. Fill a small bowl of water for dipping your fingers into. Having all the ingredients ready and together will help make assembling the kimbap much easier.Place a sheet of gim, shiny side-down, on the rolling mat. Use your fingers to spread about 3/4 cup of rice evenly on top of the seaweed, leaving about an inch border uncovered at the top. Lightly dampen your fingers with water to prevent the rice from sticking to them. Dip a finger into the water and lightly dampen the inch border of seaweed. This will help seal it after you roll it.Simply Recipes / Cynthia ChristensenSimply Recipes / Cynthia Christensen | Add the fillings:Place about one sixth of the prepared carrots, spinach, beef, and danmuji on the center of the rice—they will lay in a strip from left to right.Simply Recipes / Cynthia Christensen | Roll the kimbap:Lift the end of the rolling mat closest to you to fold the gim over the filling, squeezing gently and evenly. Tuck the filling in with your fingers and continue rolling and squeezing until you reach the end of the roll. Pull the end of the mat out and above the roll. Press into the dampened border to seal it, seam-side down.Brush the outside of the roll with a little sesame oil.Simply Recipes / Cynthia ChristensenSimply Recipes / Cynthia ChristensenSimply Recipes / Cynthia ChristensenSimply Recipes / Cynthia ChristensenSimply Recipes / Cynthia Christensen | Cut and serve the kimbap:Roll the remaining kimbap. The gim will become more pliable as it sits, making it easier to cut. Use a sharp knife to cut the kimbap into 6 to 8 pieces. Serve at room temperature.Kimbap is best served soon after making. In the unlikely event that you have leftovers, store in an airtight container with parchment between each layer. Allow them to come to room temperature before eating; otherwise, the rice will be hard. My mom used to dip leftover kimbap inpajeonbatter and pan fry in oil for a treat!Did you love the recipe?

Jibarito Sandwich,,20 minutes,18 minutes,4 servings,1/3 cup limes; 1/4 cup vegetable oil; 4  cloves garlic; 1 1/2 tablespoons adobo; 2 teaspoons onion powder; 1 teaspoon dried oregano; 1 teaspoon ground cumin; 1/2 teaspoon black pepper; 2 pounds ribeye steaks,"Prepare the steak marinade:In a quart mason jar, combine the lime juice, vegetable oil, garlic paste, adobo, onion powder, oregano, cumin, and black pepper. Screw the lid on tightly and shake the jar vigorously for 40 seconds to 1 minute until the ingredients are well combined.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Marinate the steaks:Pour the marinade into a shallow dish or sturdy zip-top food storage bag. Add the ribeye steaks to the marinade, flipping each to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to 12 hours.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Mix the mayo-ketchup:In a 1-quart mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, ketchup, lime juice, granulated garlic, and adobo until smooth.Cover the mixing bowl and refrigerate the mayo-ketchup until you’re ready to assemble the sandwiches. The mayo-ketchup can be prepared 5 days in advance and stored in the refrigerator.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Peel and cut the plantains:20 minutes before you plan to sear the steaks, peel the plantains by cutting 1/2 inch off each end to remove the stems. Use the tip of a paring knife to cut a slit down the backside length of the plantain. Using the meaty part of your thumb, push up the peel to remove it from the plantain.Once the plantain is peeled, slice it in half down its length. Repeat with the remaining plantains.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Prepare your frying station:In a 12-inch frying pan, fill the pan with 2 inches of vegetable oil and heat over medium heat.While you’re waiting for the oil to heat, prepare a draining station by placing a cooling rack over a sheet pan, or line a sheet pan with paper towels to absorb the frying oil.Set your oven to “warm” to hold the tostones once you’re done frying them.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Fry the plantains:Once the oil reaches 330°F, or forms little bubbles around the handle of a wooden spoon when you put it in the oil, add 4 slabs of plantain (you’ll cook these in two batches).Fry the plantains for 2 minutes, then use a pair of tongs to carefully flip them over. Fry the plantains for another 2 minutes, or until the tip of a knife slides in and out of the plantain with no resistance. Remove the plantains from the oil using tongs and place onto the sheet pan to absorb any extra oil.Repeat with the second batch of plantains.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Remove the steaks from the fridge:Before smashing the plantains, remove the steaks from the refrigerator to allow them to come to room temperature slightly. | Smash the plantains:Increase the frying pan of oil to medium-high heat while you smash the plantains.Place the plantain slab on a cutting board and lay a piece of parchment or wax paper over it. Press the plantain with a heavy pan (a cast iron skillet works well for this) to smash to a thickness of 1/3 inch.Slide a knife or thin spatula to separate the bottom of the plantain from the cutting board and return it to the rack.Smash the remaining plantains until they are all flat.Simply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Refry the plantains:Once the oil in the pan reaches 350°F (180°C), return the flattened plantains to the oil to fry them a second time. You will need to work in batches of 2 or 3 to avoid crowding the pan.Fry the plantains for 2 minutes on each side or until the edges are slightly brown and the exteriors are crispy.Remove the tostones from the oil using a pair of tongs and set them on the rack to drain while you fry the remaining plantains.Once all of the tostones are fried, place the sheet pan in the oven to keep warm while you sear the steaks.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Sear the steaks:Heat a 12-inch or larger skillet over medium-high heat. Once heat radiates from the pan, pour in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil.Carefully, lay the steaks in the pan and use your fingers or a pair of tongs to press it down onto the skillet’s surface. This contact ensures an even sear. Sear the meat for 4 minutes (for medium-rare). Use a pair of tongs to flip the steaks to the other side and sear for another 4 minutes.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Let the steaks rest:Remove the steaks from the pan and allow them to rest for 5 minutes. | Assemble the jibarito sandwiches:Assemble the sandwiches by spreading 1 1/2 tablespoons of the mayo-ketchup onto each tostón. Lay a slice of cheese on the bottom of 4 tostones, followed by 1 piece of steak, a leaf of lettuce, two slices of tomato, and a few slices of onion. Top these with another slice of cheese and cover them with the top tostón.Serve the jibarito immediately.Did you love the recipe?

Potato Knishes,,40 minutes,90 minutes,12 servings,2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon salt; 1/2 cup water; 1/2 cup oil; 1 large egg large egg; 1 teaspoon white vinegar,"Prepare the dough:Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add the water, oil, egg, and vinegar and pulse until just combined. It will resemble a shaggy dough that no longer sticks to the side of the bowl.TipYou can also make the dough by hand. Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, make a well, then add the liquid ingredients and mix until completely combined, using your hands as needed to bring it together.Transfer the dough to a large bowl and cover with a kitchen towel. Let rest for 1 hour at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator.Simply Recipes / Micah SivaSimply Recipes / Micah SivaSimply Recipes / Micah Siva | Cook the onions:While the dough is resting, make the filling. Heat the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until they have browned and softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from the heat and season with salt and pepper.Simply Recipes / Micah Siva | Preheat the oven to 375°F.Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. | Cook the potatoes and assemble the filling:Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in a pot of salted boiling water until fork tender, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and transfer to a medium bowl. Add the cooked onions to the potatoes along with the butter. Mash with a potato masher or fork until smooth.

Roll the dough around the filling and into a log. Not too tight—it should roll around the filling 3 to 5 times.Simply Recipes / Micah SivaSimply Recipes / Micah Siva | Form the knishes:Use your finger to make 11 indents equally spaced down the log approximately 2 inches apart. Use a small knife to cut the log at these points, making 12 knishes.Pinch at one end to seal; this will be the bottom of the knish. Pinch and twist at the other end or leave open.Simply Recipes / Micah SivaSimply Recipes / Micah Siva | Brush with egg wash and bake:Combine the whisked egg and water in a small bowl. Place the knishes on the prepared baking sheet evenly spaced apart, pinched-side down. Use a pastry brush to brush each knish with the egg wash.Bake until golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Serve with deli-style mustard.Store leftover knishes in a paper towel-lined airtight container for up to 5 days in the fridge or 3 months in the freezer.

Let soak while you cook the mushrooms.Simply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Sear the mushrooms:Tip BoxThe next two steps involve cooking the mushrooms in two batches, one pan-seared and one sauteed; I like the combination in texture and flavor of the mushrooms from both methods.Set a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add in the canola oil. When the oil shimmers, add about half of the mushrooms and sear on one side for 5 minutes until the bottoms are nicely browned.Resist the urge to stir the mushrooms, as this helps give a nice sear. Use tongs to flip them, then sear on the other side for 3 to 4 minutes until browned. Remove from the pan and season with 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper.Simply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Sauté the remaining mushrooms and aromatics:Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add the olive oil. Sauté the remaining mushrooms, onion, and garlic for 8 to 10 minutes (or until the onions are soft and translucent). Add another 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper to the mixture, then stir in the rest of the mushrooms. | Cook the farro:Pour the soaked farro and vegetable broth into the pot with the onions, garlic, and cooked mushrooms. Be sure to scrape up any stuck bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon.Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Let the farro simmer, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until the grains feel tender but still have a slight chew.Stir occasionally, and if you notice that the water is level is too low, you can add an additional 1/2 cup of broth at a time. Taste and season again with salt and pepper, if needed. Turn the heat off, then place the lid on to keep warm.Simply Recipes / Karishma PradhanSimply Recipes / Karishma PradhanSimply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Make the herb yogurt:While the farro cooks, prepare the yogurt. In a small bowl, combine the yogurt, parsley, garlic, and water. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.Simply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Fry the eggs:Just before serving, fry the eggs. Crack two eggs into a small bowl and set them aside. Also, set aside two plates.Set a large non-stick skillet over medium heat and add 2 teaspoons of olive oil. When the oil is hot, carefully pour the eggs into the skillet.Cook for 1 minute, watching as the egg begins to blister and bubble. Place the lid on the pan for 1 to 2 minutes or until whites are set. Season with salt and black pepper.Use a non-stick spatula to transfer to the plate and cover with the other plate to keep warm.Crack the remaining two eggs in the bowl, add another 2 teaspoons of olive oil to the pan, and repeat the frying process.Simply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Assemble grain bowl:To serve, divide the mushroom farro among 4 bowls. Top each bowl with an egg and a dollop of herb yogurt. Serve warm.Simply Recipes / Karishma Pradhan | Storage:Store leftover mushroom farro, herb yogurt, and eggs in separate airtight containers in the fridge.

Pepperoni Rolls,,20 minutes,40 minutes,12 servings,1/4 cup water; 2 1/4 teaspoons dry yeast; 451 g all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon salt; 113 g) unsalted butter; 2 tablespoons honey; 3/4 cup buttermilk; 1 large egg; 9 ounces pepperoni,"Proof the yeast and measure the flour:In a small bowl, place 1/4 cup warm water and sprinkle the yeast over it. Let it sit until dissolved and creamy, about 5 minutes.Meanwhile, in a large mixing bowl, combine 3 cups (387g) flour and salt.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Melt the butter, then add the milk, honey, and egg:In a small saucepan, melt 4 tablespoons butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in the honey and buttermilk, and heat just until warm to the touch (do not boil). Remove from heat and whisk in the egg.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Make the dough:Add the water and yeast mixture to the flour, along with the buttermilk mixture. Mix with a wooden spoon until the dough just comes together. At first it will be quite sticky. If needed, add the remaining 1/2 cup (64g) flour, bit by bit. Resist the temptation to add a lot of flour; you want a soft dough that’s still kneadable.Transfer to a clean counter and gently knead by hand until smooth and supple, about 5 minutes. I don’t need to flour my counter—if the dough sticks, it needs more flour. Place the dough in a large, greased bowl, cover, and let rise on your counter until doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours.Simply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Preheat the oven to 350°F:Position racks in the upper and lower thirds and line two baking sheets with parchment. | Divide the dough and prep for baking:Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces and let them rest on a lightly floured surface for 10 minutes.Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Divide the pepperoni into 12 roughly equal piles.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Form the rolls, then let them rise:Take a piece of dough and pat it into a square roughly 4 to 5 inches across. Imperfection is totally acceptable here, and in fact slightly preferable. Shingle the pepperoni slices over the square, leaving a 1/4-inch border around the dough. Roll up the dough and firmly pinch the bottom seam to seal. Place it seam-side-down on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough. You’ll wind up with 6 rolls per sheet.Brush the rolls with half of the melted butter. Cover each baking sheet with a clean dish towel and let rise for 30 minutes. The rolls will not puff up visibly.Simply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Bake the rolls and serve:Bake until lightly browned, 30 to 40 minutes, rotating the sheets from top to bottom and back to front halfway through baking. Immediately after removing from the oven, brush with the remaining butter—you may need to rewarm the butter slightly before brushing.Serve warm or at room temperature. Keep the cooled rolls at room temperature in a tightly sealed plastic bag or wrapped in plastic wrap for up to 3 days.To freeze the baked rolls, cool completely. Wrap each roll in plastic wrap, then in foil, and then pop the individually wrapped rolls in a zip top storage bag. Freeze for up to 1 month.

Stir to combine.Simply Recipes / Lori Rice | Add olive oil and marinate:Add enough olive oil to just cover the salad. For the best flavor, let it marinate for at least 1 hour at room temperature or overnight in the fridge.Stir the salad, taste, and add more black pepper or vinegar if you’d like. It probably does not need more salt because the olives, anchovy, and capers are salty enough.You will have about 4 cups of olive salad, of which you will use about 2 cups in the sandwich. Think of the leftovers as a gift for tossing with pasta, to spoon over cream cheese for dipping, or to make another muffuletta! It will keep, covered in oil and refrigerated, for at least 1 month.Simply Recipes / Lori Rice | Prepare the bread:Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally and use your hands to hollow out each half by removing the soft bread inside. This will create cavities for the filling. Leave 1/2-inch of soft bread near the crust, taking care not to tear through the crust.Simply Recipes / Lori Rice | Spread the olive salad:Stir the salad once more to reincorporate the oil and seasonings, then spread about 2 cups total on the 2 pieces of bread. Use the back of a spoon to really smoosh it down into the bread, covering the entire surface.Simply Recipes / Lori Rice | Assemble the meats and cheeses:Layer the salami, capicola, mortadella, mozzarella, and provolone on the bottom piece of bread. Carefully flip the top piece of bread on top.Simply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori Rice | Wrap it and let it rest:Tightly wrap the muffuletta with foil and allow it to sit for at least 1 hour at room temperature for the flavors to marry and the oil to soak into the bread.Simply Recipes / Lori RiceSimply Recipes / Lori Rice | Serve:Remove the foil and cut the muffuletta into 4 wedges and serve.Tightly wrap any leftover sandwich with plastic wrap or foil and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

Mix with your hands until combined; it’s okay if there are a few bread chunks still. | Shape the meatballs:Using wet hands, shape the mixture into about 16 even meatballs—each should be around 1 ounce, or 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Coat each meatball in breadcrumbs and set it on a baking sheet while you shape the rest of the meatballs.Simply Recipes / Nick Evans | Sear the meatballs:Add the olive oil to a large skillet over medium heat. Once it’s glistening hot, add the meatballs, searing for a few minutes on every side. Once seared, transfer the meatballs to a medium saucepan and add the marinara sauce.Simply Recipes / Nick Evans | Simmer the meatballs:Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Add up to 1 cup of water to the pot if the marinara sauce seems too thick. Once the sauce is simmering, turn the heat down to low and cover with the lid, leaving it ajar so some steam can escape. Simmer until the meatballs are cooked through and the sauce has thickened, about 30 minutes.TipAt this point, you can make the meatball subs immediately or transfer the meatballs and sauce to a covered container and store in the fridge for up to 5 days, making subs at your convenience.Simply Recipes / Nick EvansSimply Recipes / Nick Evans | Assemble and bake the meatball subs:Preheat the oven to 450˚F.Heat a skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.
