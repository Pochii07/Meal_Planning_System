Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer, swirling the pot once or twice, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar dissolves and the marinade reduces slightly.Transfer the marinade into a heatproof container with a tight-fitting lid and wide enough to hold 6 eggs in a single layer.

Cover the saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.Use a slotted spoon, if necessary, to carefully add the eggs into the steamer basket in a single layer. Cover the saucepan and steam the eggs over medium-high heat for 6 to 7 minutes. For a custardy, almost runny yolk, go for 6 minutes. 7 minutes will give you a slightly firmer but still jammy yolk. Don't guess the time! Use a timer!If you don’t have a steamer basket: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. There should be enough water that the eggs are fully submerged.

Fill a medium bowl with a lot of ice and cold water, and set it next to the stove. When the eggs are done cooking, use a spoon to immediately transfer them into the ice bath to fully cool.Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel | Peel the eggs:One egg at a time, use the back of a spoon to tap it all over to crack the shell. Peel the egg starting at the wide bottom end. That’s where the air pocket divot is, making it easier to peel. Dip the eggs into the ice bath to rinse off any stuck-on eggshells. Set the peeled eggs on a paper towel and pat them dry. | Marinate the eggs:Add the eggs to the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. The eggs will become saltier in the marinade so don’t let them sit longer than 24 hours.Leftovers should be removed from the marinade and kept in a container with a tight-fitting lid.
