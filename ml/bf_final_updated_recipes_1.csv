No Knead Cinnamon Raisin Bread (Dutch Oven),"This no knead cinnamon raisin bread is easy and fast, with a short two-hour rise time, and baked in the Dutch oven for a perfectly crusty crust and fluffy texture inside!",5 minutes,40 minutes,8,"1  cups water; 2  teaspoons active dry yeast (one packet, see notes); 2 tablespoons sugar more if you want it extra sweet;  cup raisins; 1 tablespoon cinnamon;  tablespoon fine grain salt; 3  cups all-purpose flour see notes, plus more for dusting/shaping","Microwave the 1 ½ cups water until it's 100 degrees F - 110 degrees F (this takes one minute on high in my microwave) . In a large bowl or the bowl of a standing mixer, mix 1 cup of the warm water with the 2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast and 2 tablespoons sugar and stir until everything is dissolved. Allow to stand for 10 minutes, after which the yeast should have started multiplying resulting in the mixture foaming up to about double its size. | Meanwhile, pour the remaining ½ cup of warm water over the ¾ cup raisins in a small bowl and mix together and allow to sit for 10 minutes. This will rehydrate the raisins a bit and make them plumper and softer. | Add the raisin and warm water mixture, the 1 tablespoon cinnamon , the ½ tablespoon fine grain salt , and the 3 ½ cups all-purpose flour to the bowl with the water yeast mixture. Mix using a dough hook on the standing mixer, or with a sturdy wooden spoon if mixing by hand, for at least 1 minute, until all the ingredients are well combined. (If using a standing mixer or you want a great arm workout, mix for longer, which will develop more gluten and result in a stronger dough). | Gather the dough at the bottom of the bowl by scraping the sides down. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel and allow to rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size (see notes for recommendations on warm places to allow dough to rise. At this point, if you like, you can refrigerate the dough for up to 7 days and bake when you are ready. A cold dough has some benefits, as it is easier to shape and form, and the longer the dough sits the more developed in flavor it will be. Or, you can bake immediately!) | Optional : during the last 30 minutes of the dough rising, preheat your Dutch oven by placing it, covered, in your oven while it preheats to 450 degrees F. This isn't entirely necessary but the extra heat will give the dough a bit of a boost when it comes to how tall and fluffy it comes out. | Carefully and gently transfer the dough to the edge of a piece of parchment paper that has been sprinkled with a dusting of flour (or on the counter, depending on how you want to shape it). Shape the dough into an oval or circular loaf shape (see notes for tips on shaping). Score the top of the loaf with a sharp knife or razor blade. | Using the parchment paper, transfer the loaf AND the parchment paper into the Dutch oven. If you preheated the Dutch oven, be very careful doing this as it will be very hot, and do NOT FORGET to grab the lid using potholders, for the love of all that is good and holy. | Optional: If you want, you can place a couple of ice cubes on the side of the Dutch Oven in between the parchment and the side of the pot. This will melt and create more steam as it bakes, but it's not 100% necessary. | Place the lid on the Dutch oven and bake at 450 degrees F for 35 minutes. Then, uncover and bake for another 5-10 minutes, until nice and brown on top. | Remove loaf (CAREFULLY!) from the hot Dutch Oven and place on a cooling rack.

Goetta Recipe (Cincinnati Breakfast Classic),Goetta is essentially a simple pork and beef sausage stretched out with oats. It’s sliced and griddled until crispy and most often served at breakfast with eggs and toast. ,20 minutes,180 minutes,22 servings,4 cups water; 2 1/2 cups steel-cut oats; 10 g salt; 1 pound ground pork; 1 pound ground beef; 2 teaspoons poultry seasoning; 2 teaspoons onion powder; 2 teaspoons garlic powder; 1 teaspoon white pepper; 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper; 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg; 4 cups low-sodium beef stock; 2 bay leaves bay leaves,"Cook the oats:In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, bring the water, oats, and 1 teaspoon of the salt to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer and cook uncovered, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until very thick and creamy, about 30 minutes.Simply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Mix the meat and seasonings:In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the ground pork and beef, seasonings, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Mix on low speed until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes.With the machine running on low, slowly pour in 2 cups of the beef stock and mix until sticky, about 2 minutes. Mixing the meats until they are sticky helps form a protein bond that’ll make your finished goetta less crumbly and have a more sausage-like texture.TipIf you don’t have a stand mixer, you can thoroughly knead the mixture together by hand.Simply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Add the meat mixture and stock and cook until very thick:Transfer the meat mixture to the pot with the oats. Add the remaining beef stock and stir well to make a light pink sludge. Add the bay leaves, then raise the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.Reduce the heat as low as it can go and cook, uncovered, 1 to 2 hours, stirring every 5 minutes or so to prevent the oats from sticking to the bottom and scorching. It’ll slowly turn brown and then, as the liquid evaporates, it’ll look less like oatmeal and more like a chunky, brownish-gray peanut butter.It should require more and more effort to stir the longer it cooks (if in doubt, cook longer). When it’s ready, it’ll be quite stiff, and you’ll easily see the bottom of the pot when you drag the spoon through the mixture.Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed; it should be salty the way sausage is salty. Remove the bay leaves and set the pot aside for now.Simply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Fill the loaf pans:Line the bottoms of two 8 1/2x4 1/2 or 9x5-inch loaf pans with parchment. Grease the pans and parchment with cooking spray.Divide the mixture between the pans and smooth the tops. Let the pans cool on the counter for at least 1 hour, then refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours to set.TipLeaving the pan uncovered allows the goetta to form a skin on top that helps it keep its shape when you slice it.Simply Recipes / Ciara KehoeSimply Recipes / Ciara Kehoe | Wrap and store:Slide a thin metal spatula between the parchment and the goetta to loosen it, then unmold the loaf and wrap it well in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 1 year.TipFor easy portioning, slice the goetta before freezing. Wrap several slices tightly in plastic wrap and then place the bundles in a large freezer bag so you can remove only as much goetta as you need at a time. Thaw the goetta overnight in the refrigerator. | Fry the goetta to serve:Even though the goetta is fully cooked, it’s always served sliced and fried or griddled. Cut the loaf into 1/2-inch slices.Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil or bacon fat in a skillet (preferably nonstick or cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the goetta, being careful not to crowd the pan, and cook 5 to 10 minutes per side, disturbing the goetta as little as possible so you don’t break up the crispy brown crust as it forms.

A couple of thoughtful techniques plus mashed banana make these chocolate-studded muffins tender, moist, and hard to resist.",10 minutes,17 minutes,12 servings,"236 g all-purpose flour; 1 teaspoon baking powder; 1/2 teaspoon baking soda; 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt; 150 g granulated sugar; 84 g unsalted butter; 3 tablespoons oil; 1 large egg large egg; 1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract; 3/4 cup mashed overripe banana; 3/4 cup buttermilk; 185 g semi-sweet chocolate chips, divided","Combine the flour, leavening, and salt:In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt to combine and set aside.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Mix the sugar, butter, and oil:In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, melted butter, and oil until well combined, about 15 seconds.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Add the remaining wet ingredients:Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Vigorously whisk until the egg is completely broken up and the mixture is well combined and lightened in color, 30 seconds to 1 minute.Add the mashed banana to the butter mixture and whisk until fully combined, about 30 seconds. There shouldn’t be any big chunks of banana. Add the buttermilk and whisk until combined.Simply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Combine the wet and dry ingredients:Add the flour mixture to the bowl with the wet ingredients and whisk until just combined and no dry bits remain. It’s okay if the batter looks a little lumpy.Add 3/4 cup of the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, reserving the remaining 1/4 cup for topping the muffins. Gently fold the mini chocolate chips into the batter just until the chips are evenly dispersed. Don’t overmix!Simply Recipes / Mark BeahmSimply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Rest the batter:Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the batter to rest at room temperature for 1 hour. Resting the batter allows the flour to hydrate which in turn reduces some of the spread of the muffin tops and helps create even, rounded tops.If you’re short on time, you can skip this step. | While the batter rests, preheat the oven and prepare the muffin tins:Arrange a rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven to 400°F.Line every other cavity of 2 standard-size muffin tins with paper liners. There should be 12 total lined cavities. Allowing this space helps the muffins to rise and bake more evenly and reduces the likelihood of the muffins baking into each other. If you only own one muffin tin, you can fill each cavity and bake them all side-by-side.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Divide the batter:Using a 2 1/2-inch scoop (about 1/3 cup), scoop 12 portions of batter into the lined cavities of the muffin tin, filling slightly over 3/4 full. Depending on the capacity of your muffin pans, you might get 13 muffins. Top each muffin with the remaining mini chocolate chips.Simply Recipes / Mark Beahm | Bake and cool:To yield maximum oven spring (and in turn a better rise and texture), the muffins are baked at 2 temperatures.Arrange the pans on the middle rack of the oven. Bake the muffins at 400°F for 9 minutes. Without opening the oven door, lower the temperature to 350°F and bake for 4 more minutes. Rotate the pans and bake until the muffins are golden brown around the edges, spring back when gently poked, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 4 to 6 minutes more (17 to 19 minutes total bake time).Let the muffins cool slightly in the pans set over a wire rack for a few minutes. Transfer the muffins to a wire rack to finish cooling. Serve warm or at room temperature.Leftover muffin tops can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.TipI love to reheat leftover muffins in the microwave for a few seconds or until the chocolate is melted again.Love the recipe?

Cháo Gà (Vietnamese Chicken and Rice Porridge),"Cháo gà is a Vietnamese chicken and rice porridge that is basically comfort in a bowl. Make a giant pot and enjoy it again and again throughout the week.

",45 minutes,90 minutes,"6
to 8 servings",1 yellow onion yellow onion; 3 1/2 pound) whole chicken; 1 tablespoon sea salt; 1 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar; 1 teaspoon chicken; 250 250g jasmine rice; 2 inch fresh ginger; 1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce; 2 teaspoons ground black pepper,"Bring water to a boil:Bring 2 1/2 quarts (10 cups) of water to a boil in a kettle or pot. | Meanwhile, char the onion:Peel and cut the stem and root ends off the onion to create a flat top and bottom. Set a small frying pan over high heat, place the onion on its flat side to char until blackened, then flip to char the other flat side. | Cook the chicken:Place the charred onion and chicken in a large pot. Pour the boiling water over it and season with salt, rock sugar, and chicken or mushroom bouillon, if using. Set the pot over low heat and simmer covered for 1 hour.NoteUnlike the Western-style of poaching chicken and making chicken stock, this method of pouring boiling water over chicken is used in many Asian cuisines. It results in a succulent and juicy chicken. Typically, the boiling water is poured on and changed out once in the beginning to rinse the chicken, but for the sake of ease, I skipped this extra step in this recipe.Simply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Chill the chicken:Fill a large bowl with very cold water and set it next to the stovetop. Use a spider to carefully scoop the cooked chicken out of the pot into the cold water bath. Allow the chicken to chill for about 15 minutes in the water bath. Then, drain it into a colander set in the sink. This will stop the chicken from cooking and makes sure it stays very tender.Do not discard the hot chicken stock in the pot. You will use it to cook the rice porridge. You can discard the onion. | Rinse and cook the rice:While the chicken chills, rinse the rice well under cold running water (at least 3 times) and drain well. Add it to the chicken stock along with the ginger—set aside 1 teaspoon of the ginger for the dipping sauce.Cover the pot with a lid and bring it to the boil over medium heat. Skim off any fat and foam that floats to the top with a large spoon. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 25 to 30 minutes until the rice has blossomed and thickened the broth, stirring occasionally. Season the porridge with fish sauce and 1 teaspoon black pepper. If the porridge is too thick for your liking, you can thin it out by adding a little water.Simply Recipes / Uyen LuuSimply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Meanwhile, tear the chicken:While the rice cooks, use your hands to tear the chicken meat along the grain into 1/3-inch-wide strips, removing and discarding the bones. Add the pulled chicken on a large plate and toss with the remaining 1 teaspoon black pepper.Simply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Make the salad:In a large bowl, add the cabbage, carrots, red onion, vinegar, sugar, and black pepper. Toss well to combine. Add the pulled chicken and cilantro, and toss to combine. Set it aside.Simply Recipes / Uyen LuuSimply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Make the dipping sauce:In a small bowl, combine the reserved 1 teaspoon ginger, chilis, vinegar, sugar, and fish sauce. Set it aside.Simply Recipes / Uyen LuuSimply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Fry the shallots:Set a small frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the oil and shallots, and fry until golden and crispy, stirring occasionally. Transfer the shallots and the flavorful oil into a small bowl.Simply Recipes / Uyen Luu | Serve the porridge:To serve, ladle the warm porridge into soup bowls. Invite your guests to top the porridge to their liking with the fried shallots, scallions, cilantro, and black pepper. I recommend providing each guest with a small bowl of the dipping sauce. The salad is typically dipped into the sauce, not served on top of the porridge.Cháo is best served immediately, but some would argue that making it ahead of time is even better. Store it in the fridge for a couple of days. It’ll thicken up as it sits and the rice soaks up the broth. Loosen it by adding more broth or water when you reheat it either on the stovetop or microwave. If reheating in the microwave, stir it well halfway through.Did you love the recipe?

French Omelette,"A classic French omelette is elegant and chic, a beauty to behold. The smooth, pale yellow exterior envelops soft curds of creamy, delicate eggs. It’s almond-shaped and has no filling— just eggs, glorified in their gentle essence.",3 minutes,5 minutes,1 serving,3 large eggs; Pinch salt; Pinch white pepper; 1 tablespoon unsalted butter; chopped chopped chives,"Beat the eggs:In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until no traces of white remain. Whisk in the salt and white pepper.Sally Vargas / Simply Recipes | Melt the butter:In an 8-inch nonstick skillet with rounded sides set over medium heat, melt the butter, being careful not to let it brown. Swirl it around in the pan so it coats the bottom and sides. | Cook the eggs:Pour the eggs into the pan. With the bowl of a fork, tines facing up, rapidly stir the eggs. If you’re concerned about scraping the nonstick surface of your pan, use a plastic fork. Move the fork all around the pan to break up the eggs as they cook. At the same time, hold the handle of the pan with the other hand and vigorously shake the pan back and forth.If the eggs cook too fast, forming large clumps, take the pan off the heat and keep stirring. The eggs will continue to cook a little from the residual heat. Cook until the eggs are loose and creamy with small curds. This will only take 2 to 3 minutes.Sally Vargas / Simply Recipes | Roll the omelette:If you haven’t already done so, remove the pan from the heat. Run the fork around the edges to release the eggs. Tilt the pan to a 45-degree angle so that the eggs move to one side of the pan.Keep the pan tilted and fold the eggs toward the edge until you have a half moon shape, running the fork under and around the eggs as needed to loosen them from the pan.With the pan still tilted, sharply tap the handle 2 or 3 times with your free hand to push the eggs over the edge by about 2 inches. If this makes no sense, that’s okay—use a spatula to gently coax the eggs about 2 inches over the edge of the pan. Use your fork to fold the overhanging eggs up and towards the center of the omelette. It should now be almond-shaped.Sally Vargas / Simply RecipesSally Vargas / Simply RecipesSally Vargas / Simply Recipes | Transfer the omelette onto a plate:Hold onto the handle as close to the pan as possible. Bang the still tilted pan on the counter to move the omelette right up to the edge of the pan. Tilt a plate right next to the omelette and tip it onto the plate so the seam is on the bottom. | Serve the omeletteSprinkle with chives or parsley, if you’d like, and serve.The omelette is best eaten just after you make it. The texture will change, but you could wrap leftovers in plastic wrap and store it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. To reheat, cover it with a dampened paper towel and microwave in 30-second intervals, until heated through. The key is to reheat it gently, so the eggs don’t overcook.Did you love the recipe?

To knead, use your fingers to bring one edge of the dough into the center then press down with the end of your palm. Use your knuckles to massage as you go along. Do this for a couple of minutes.Rub a little oil on your hands and drizzle over the dough. Gently knead again. Rub oil along the inside of the bowl and bottom of the bowl and place dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 45 minutes until doubled in size.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-SenhouseSimply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-SenhouseSimply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-SenhouseSimply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Combine the filling ingredients:In a large mixing bowl, combine coconut, water, butter, vanilla extract, almond extract, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a few drops of food coloring.

Add the coconut filling and sauté until sugar is melted and filling smells fragrant, 5 to 6 minutes. Set aside to cool until room temperature, about 10 minutes.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Knead the rested dough:Remove plastic wrap from the bowl, using your hands, punch the dough down to remove large air bubbles. Knead gently for 3 to 4 minutes to remove smaller air bubbles until the dough is soft and pliable.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-SenhouseSimply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Roll out the dough:Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface—using a rolling pin, roll out dough into a rectangular shape around 16 inches by 14 inches and 1/4 to 3/4 inches in thickness. This measurement does not have to be exact or perfectly rectangular but get it as close to this as possible.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Add the filling to dough:Evenly spread filling on dough using a silicone spatula. I prefer a spatula because it doesn't tug at the dough when spreading. Leave about an inch around the edges without filling.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Roll the dough:From the longest side, roll the salara into a log. Pinch the edges to seal the dough closed so the filling doesn’t seep out during baking. Once it’s sealed gently tuck it under for a rounded edge. Fold each end under to seal.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Preheat the oven to 350°F.Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. | Let the salara rest before baking:Lift the salara onto the parchment-lined baking sheet and place diagonally. You can use a silicone spatula to help with lifting one end.Allow the salara to rest on the baking sheet for 25 minutes uncovered to allow the dough portion to rise for a second time.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Bake:Bake salara for 25 to 26 minutes. You’ll know it’s done when it is evenly browned and your kitchen smells fragrant. Another way to test for doneness is if you press the salara with a spatula and the cooked dough springs back without a dent. | Brush the salara with melted butter and let cool:When salara is done, immediately brush melted butter all over the top and sides. Cover with plastic wrap and kitchen towel. Let it cool completely before slicing.Simply Recipes / Alica Ramkirpal-Senhouse | Serve:Cut salara into 12 to 13 slices.

If you scoop the flour, it will pack into the measuring cup, yielding too much flour.Simply Recipes / Cambrea Bakes | Cut in the shortening and butter:Using a fork or a pastry blender, cut in the shortening and butter.

Pre-baking the crust will ensure that the bottom crust is browned and won't get soggy. I often skip this step and find that although the bottom crust might not get browned, it's usually perfectly palatable.To pre-bake a store-bought crust, just follow the directions on the crust package.To pre-bake the homemade crust in this recipe, line the inside with aluminum foil and fill it with pie weights such as beans. The foil and the pie weights will help keep the sides of the crust from sliding down as it bakes.Bake for 15 minutes at 375°F, then remove the foil and weights, prick the bottom of the crust with the tines of a fork , and bake for another 10 minutes. Let cool down a bit before filling with the quiche custard filling. | Cook the shallots:Melt butter in a small saucepan on medium heat. Add the minced shallots and cook 3 to 4 minutes until translucent. Remove from heat.Elise Bauer | Prepare the filling:Preheat oven to 375°F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl.

to 15 servings",237 ml) whole milk; 2 teaspoons yeast; 50 g) sugar; 560 g) all-purpose flour; 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt; 42 g) unsalted butter,"Make the dough:Whisk the warmed milk with the yeast and 2 tablespoons of the sugar in a measuring cup. Set it to the side to become foamy.In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, whisk together the remaining sugar, flour, salt, 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Add the yeast-milk mixture. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms, then turn the mixer up to medium-low and knead for 10 minutes (set a timer!). When done, the dough should form a ball and spring back when you poke it.Cindy Rahe | Let the dough rise for one hour, or overnight:Gather the dough into a ball with your hands and place into a greased bowl. Cover well with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise on the counter for 1 hour, until doubled in size, or place in the fridge to rise overnight. (The dough may not quite double in size if you're refrigerating overnight, but it should look risen and puffed.) | Make the apples while the dough rises (or before assembling, if you've chilled the dough overnight):Melt the butter for the apples in a medium skillet. Add the diced apples, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for about five minutes until the apples are just tender. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. (The apples can be made up to a day ahead and kept refrigerated.)Cindy Rahe | Make the caramel sauce:In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/2 cup of the apple cider, and stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring, increase the heat to medium-low, and bring the mixture to a boil.Continue to boil (without stirring!) until the sugar turns a deep golden caramel color, 320F to 330F. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, followed by the salt, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons of cider. Whisk until smooth. (Caramel sauce can be cooled and refrigerated for several days; warm briefly in the microwave or on the stovetop, until it's a ""drizzle"" consistency, before assembling.)Cindy Rahe | Assemble the monkey bread:Grease a bundt pan well and set aside. Melt the butter needed for assembly. In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon.Tear off walnut- or golf ball-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls between your hands, They don’t have to be uniform! Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, roll in cinnamon sugar, and place in the bottom of the prepared bundt until there is a good layer on the bottom of the pan (using up about half the dough).Spoon all of the apples over the dough, followed by a third of the caramel sauce. Continue rolling the remaining dough and layering in the pan. Drizzle another third of the caramel sauce over the top. (Save the rest of the caramel sauce for serving).Cindy RaheCindy Rahe | Let the monkey bread rise for 30 to 60 minutes:Cover the monkey bread with plastic wrap. Room temperature dough will take about 30 minutes to rise; dough that's cold from the fridge will take 30 to 60 minutes. Let the monkey bread rise until the top looks slightly puffed and pillowy.Cindy Rahe | Preheat the oven to 350°F. | Bake the monkey bread:Uncover the bundt pan and transfer to a sheet pan (to catch butter drips!). Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. When done, the top should have risen slightly over the top of the pan and the bread should be a deep golden brown. | Cool and serve:Cool the monkey bread in the bundt pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Place a serving plate over the pan, and using oven mitts, flip the pan over to unmold the monkey bread onto the plate.Drizzle with the remaining caramel sauce and serve.

Set aside to soak. | Prep the rest of the batter:In a medium bowl, beat the eggs until homogenous in color. Add the sugar and oil and beat until combined. Fold into the big bowl with the soaked bran flakes. If using vanilla, add it now.In a third bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon, if using. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and fold with a spatula until all of the flour is moistened. The batter will be a bit thick, with the consistency of oatmeal, but if it’s dense and heavy, add a little more buttermilk as needed to loosen it up. | Store:You can either bake a batch of muffins right away or refrigerate the batter and bake as needed. (Muffins that you bake right after making the batter will have a bumpier surface and a nubbier texture.)Cover the bowl or transfer the batter to one or two large lidded containers and refrigerate forup to6 weeks. It may darken on the surface after a week, which is okay. Note: if you’re concerned about food safely, bake all of the batter within 3 to 5 days. | Preheat the oven to 400°F. | Bake:If the batter has been in the fridge for more than a few hours, stir it well. (If it’s gotten thick as it sat in the fridge, you can mix in a little water or milk to make it less stiff.) If you’d like to include add-ins, separate out 3 cups of batter for every dozen muffins and add no more than 1 1/2 cups add-ins.Grease your muffin tin(s) well and fill 2/3 full (I like using an ice cream scoop for this). Bake until the tops are lightly browned and spring back when you press them gently with your fingertip, about 20 minutes. Let the muffins cool in their tins for about 5 minutes before turning them out onto a wire rack to cool.Baked muffins will keep at room temperature in a plastic bag or loosely covered container for about 3 to 4 days.

",15 minutes,12 minutes,"4
to 6 servings",1 cup water; 1/2 cup soy sauce; 1 tablespoon sugar; 6 tablespoons mirin; 2 cloves garlic; unpeeled ginger piece unpeeled ginger; 6 large eggs; Ice Ice Ice,"Make the marinade:In a small saucepan, add the water, soy sauce, sugar, mirin, garlic, and ginger, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a simmer, swirling the pot once or twice, for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar dissolves and the marinade reduces slightly.Transfer the marinade into a heatproof container with a tight-fitting lid and wide enough to hold 6 eggs in a single layer. Set aside to cool. | Cook the eggs:While the marinade is simmering, fit a medium saucepan with a steamer basket and fill it with enough water to reach the bottom of a steamer basket. Cover the saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.Use a slotted spoon, if necessary, to carefully add the eggs into the steamer basket in a single layer. Cover the saucepan and steam the eggs over medium-high heat for 6 to 7 minutes. For a custardy, almost runny yolk, go for 6 minutes. 7 minutes will give you a slightly firmer but still jammy yolk. Don't guess the time! Use a timer!If you don’t have a steamer basket: Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over medium-high heat. There should be enough water that the eggs are fully submerged. As soon as it comes up to a boil, carefully add the eggs and cook for 7 minutes.Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel | Chill the eggs:While the eggs are cooking, make an ice bath. Fill a medium bowl with a lot of ice and cold water, and set it next to the stove. When the eggs are done cooking, use a spoon to immediately transfer them into the ice bath to fully cool.Simply Recipes / Alison Bickel | Peel the eggs:One egg at a time, use the back of a spoon to tap it all over to crack the shell. Peel the egg starting at the wide bottom end. That’s where the air pocket divot is, making it easier to peel. Dip the eggs into the ice bath to rinse off any stuck-on eggshells. Set the peeled eggs on a paper towel and pat them dry. | Marinate the eggs:Add the eggs to the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 24 hours. The eggs will become saltier in the marinade so don’t let them sit longer than 24 hours.Leftovers should be removed from the marinade and kept in a container with a tight-fitting lid.
